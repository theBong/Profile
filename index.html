                        In life there will be road blocks but we will over come it. We the best. Mogul talk. A major key, never panic. Don’t panic, when it gets crazy and rough, don’t panic, stay calm. Lion! Lion! I told you all this before, when you have a swimming pool, do
                        not use chlorine, use salt water, the healing, salt water is the healing. It’s on you how you want to live your life. Everyone has a choice. I pick my choice, squeaky clean. The key to success is to keep your head above the water,
                        never give up. In life you have to take the trash out, if you have trash in your life, take it out, throw it away, get rid of it, major key.

                        Lion! We don’t see them, we will never see them. Egg whites, turkey sausage, wheat toast, water. Of course they don’t want us to eat our breakfast, so we are going to enjoy our breakfast. They will try to close the door on you, just open it. I’m up to
                        something. Put it this way, it took me twenty five years to get these plants, twenty five years of blood sweat and tears, and I’m never giving up, I’m just getting started. We don’t see them, we will never see them. You smart,
