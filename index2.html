                        <p>I'm a maker at heart. My tools of choice are <strong>Python, Notion and Raspberry Pi</strong>.</p>
                        <p>My time as a developer is split 50-40-10. I spend half my time preparing my set up because I refuse to move on from Linux. The other 40 is spent learning and doing. The last 10 I keep for walks and playing with Puchkii. Hey, it's
                            <em>part of the</em> <em>process.</em></p>
                        <p>I have a fair grasp of <strong>HTML, CSS and Flask.</strong></p>
                        <p>I've dabbled a fair amount in computer vision in my time at Athenta working mostly with <strong>OpenCV</strong> and <strong>Yolo</strong>. Right now I'm pursuing a course in computer vision by Adrian Rosebrock at pyimagesearch!
                            I also set up Ubuntu servers from scratch to run <strong>Cuda</strong>, <strong>Docker and small Flask apps with OpenCV.</strong></p>
                        <p>I like to tell people I use <strong>git</strong> but internally I'm always screaming.</p>
                        <p>I am learning more product oriented skills and being part of an <strong>agile team</strong> has been a paradigm shift and I don't think I can live life without a <strong>Kanban Board.</strong></p>
                        <p>I am also comfortable interacting with clients, but occasionally I will run myself out of breath if I'm excited about the project (Disclaimer: I'm excited about everything I pick up).</p>
                        <p>I am a good <strong>team player</strong> and I am the happiest when I'm tackling <strong>creative problems</strong> with a diverse group.</p>
